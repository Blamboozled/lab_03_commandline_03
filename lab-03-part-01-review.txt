6.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the lab files can be found at this url: 

https://citytech.s3.amazonaws.com/mtec-1003-lab-03.tar.gz

Download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec-1003-lab-03.tar.gz.   Use a command that we learned to do this.

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.  MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec-1003-lab-03.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file - as well as its output - below:
----------
curl -o mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz https://citytech.s3.amazonaws.com/mtec-1003-lab-03.tar.gz

==========
8.  You should now have a directory called mtec-1003-lab-03 in your home directory.  Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist:

a. go to your home folder
b. go back to step 6

Otherwise...

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:

ls
 -1.14-windows.xml
 -u
'3D Objects'/
 AMD_Chipset_IODrivers.log
 AppData/
'Application Data'@
 Contacts/
 Cookies@
'Creative Cloud Files'/
 Desktop/
 Device_ID.log
 Documents/
 Downloads/
 Favorites/
 Links/
'Local Settings'@

9.  What directories are in the mtec-1003-lab-03 folder?

Write the command(s) that you used to determine this - as well as its output - below:
----------

cd mtec-1003-lab-03
 ls
books/  logs/  web/

==========
10.  Now... go back home.  Then change to the science-fiction directory using a relative path.  The directory is located in books... which is located in the mtec-1003-lab-03 directory.  Verify you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the command(s) (including going home) that you used to do this below:
----------
cd mtec-1003-lab-03
pwd
ls
cd books
ls other/  science-fiction/
cd science-fiction
==========
11.  Write the files that are in the science fiction directory below.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------
pwd
Desktop
cd mtec-1003-lab-03/books/science-fiction
pwd
==========
13. Immediately change back to the mtec-1003-lab-03 folder with a single command using a *relative* path.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------
cd ../..
pwd


==========
14. Find out what the most recently modified directory is in mtec-1003-lab-03 (there are only 3 to choose from)?  How would you find this out?  Hint: perhaps using something to show the modified date... and sort it by time.

----------
drwxr-xr-x 1 Alex 197609 0 Dec 26 21:19 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 Alex 197609 0 Dec 26 21:14 mtec-1003-lab-03.tar.gz
drwxr-xr-x 1 Alex 197609 0 Dec 26 21:16 ./
==========
15. Create a compressed archive of the logs folder - that is... take the contents of logs and create a single archive (.tar), and compress (.gz) (tar, gzip)
